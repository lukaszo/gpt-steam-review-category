Every thing seems more vibrant (color, item, house wise), and the interaction with my agent friend/ other people seems much more personal. This version of HF feels like things are more 3D! I'm loving the customization for the different furniture, and some of the new tools!! Being able to see more environments/styles of houses right of the get-go is nice as well! Varies things up quite a bit\n\n\nNegatives:\n\nThat being said the higher graphics make it hard to run on my computer, and even with lowest graphics settings on everything, the game has a major lag. Some problems that have arisen due to this is that the game is not automatically saving my progress (I had to do a job 3 times), and even when I click the manual save button, things such as the money I've made from selling stuff doesn't save, which means that even though the things that I have sold are gone, the money is not in my account. Another problem with the low graphics, is the fact that when trying to see the patterns/colors in the store, the resolution is so low that it doesn't let me see the patterns of the text.  \n\n The game itself, also takes some getting used to if you are transitioning from the original to this one. If you are like me, and feel more comfortable with less \"wavy/moving\" settings while walking, placing etc. you can adjust it in settings, but it still isn't completely the same. \n\nThe drag on the trackpad is real. Cleaning windows, painitng, and selling items with a trackpad seems unnecessarily hard, like I have to dig into my pad in order to move everything around.\n\nSome smaller complaints that I have are just that\nThe furniture  (basically all store items) in the game, while unique, is very limited, and also very expensive if you are just starting out. \nI miss not being able to interact/see what the customers are saying about the house you're flipping, and also the ability to see what they are looking for in the house that you are designing. \nThe minimap being gone is also a MAJOR downside; that and the progress bar being gone for specific rooms\nThings such as trash disposal are a major pain. I get the point is to make it realistc, but when does realistic become completely inconvenient. \n\n Look, while I think that this game is heading in the right direction, and am completely excited for what comes next; I'm not sure it's at it's finest yet. It's still really buggy, small, and while I'm positive I'd recommend it in the future, I'm not sure if it's worth the money I paid for it now. I think that after a few months, and a few more things are added/fixed, I think  this is going to shape up to the level of the original house flipper, or even surpass it!", "timestamp_created": 1702920361, "timestamp_updated": 1702921556, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541393697261810303", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153868366": {"recommendationid": "153868366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024455742", "num_games_owned": 516, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1087, "playtime_at_review": 1087, "last_played": 1702917918}, "language": "english", "review": "I love House Flipper and I have a lot of great time playing it... \nWith that being said i can't recommend this at the moment for a number of reasons:\n\n1. House Flipper 1 at the moment is 25 euro with so much functionality its not even funny. This game feels more like a DLC with added possibility of doing more with walls and some of the very basic gardening features added to the core of the game. This is a DLC which cost 12 euro more than the game which is far superior and better at this point.\n2. Feel like early access honestly without the tag Early Access. As mentioned previously the first edition of the game just provides way more.\n3. The variety is lacking really for a game that holds essentially the same graphics as the previous game. Much of that could have easily made it to this game but I have a very bad feeling of a paid DLC coming in instead... I hope I am wrong on this one.\n\nWith that being said I think the work that was done is great and some of the additions to the game are amazing and everything that we all wanted, but it just doesn't justify the price. \nSad really that we need to wait for months/years for content and spend probably 50 more euro for the game to get even close to what HF1 was. \n", "timestamp_created": 1702919866, "timestamp_updated": 1702919866, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153867561": {"recommendationid": "153867561", "author": {"steamid": "76561199185990363", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 295, "playtime_at_review": 295, "last_played": 1702918645}, "language": "french", "review": "nul", "timestamp_created": 1702918981, "timestamp_updated": 1702918981, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153866872": {"recommendationid": "153866872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129685581", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 677, "playtime_at_review": 677, "last_played": 1702835689}, "language": "german", "review": "Das einzige Gute ist das \u00fcberarbeitete Baumen\u00fc. 4/10", "timestamp_created": 1702918216, "timestamp_updated": 1702918216, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474967896938323975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153864652": {"recommendationid": "153864652", "author": {"steamid": "76561199005555775", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2453, "playtime_at_review": 2453, "last_played": 1702915166}, "language": "french", "review": "Bonjour apr\u00e8s 40h de jeux je suis quelques peut d\u00e9\u00e7us de ne pas avoir int\u00e9grer au jeux toutes les d\u00e9corations du jeux un , ils nous ont supprim\u00e9 les piscine les dressing  le sauna  du jeux un , toujours pas de gestion du jardin pelouse  et autre  .vous finirais les mission environ 50 20 en quelques jour ensuite on tourne en rond  et fini par ne plus jouer dommage de ne pas int\u00e9grer les dlc du premier au moins \u00e7a donnerais plus de possibilit\u00e9 .quand au mode cr\u00e9ation il est tellement compliquer a comprendre que je jette l' \u00e9ponge .pas une seul explication de comment le r\u00e9gler comment publier les maison rien nada du grand n' importe quoi", "timestamp_created": 1702915867, "timestamp_updated": 1702915867, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153863636": {"recommendationid": "153863636", "author": {"steamid": "76561199223946719", "num_games_owned": 1074, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 581, "playtime_at_review": 581, "last_played": 1702911322}, "language": "english", "review": "When everybody shout Yes, I say No.", "timestamp_created": 1702915009, "timestamp_updated": 1702915009, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.435356199741363525", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153863304": {"recommendationid": "153863304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287532780", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1702563161}, "language": "english", "review": "I wanted to like this, but it's just not as good as the first game.

They're all just props now. Buy a bush, plop it anywhere, no planting. You can even plant a bush on a bed. Flowers will fall out of planters due to physics and roll around on the floor as if they were plastic.\n\nThe only pro I can think of is that there's much more in-depth customization of purchasable furniture, but even that ends up too streamlined. You can copy and paste furniture customization with what basically amounts to a magic wand with no drawbacks from having bought the wrong stuff.\n\nThe cleaning has been dumbed down, too, I think. Or at least it feels that way with the new 'dirt radar' that highlights stains in blinding yellow so it's impossible to miss anything. There was a catharsis to tracking down every little stain and that's now missing from the feel, as well.\n\nIt's been streamlined to the point that it's no longer a simulator.

Soviel Spa\u00df machte dieser. \n\nGute Grafik, tolle Men\u00fcf\u00fchrung, Riesen Auswahl an Items und Gegenst\u00e4nde, riesige Auswahl an H\u00e4user, etc.etc.etc.\n\nNachdem ich die zahlreichen Missionen im 1. Teil fertig gespielt hatte, hatte ich immer und immer wieder H\u00e4user gekauft, renoviert, verkauft und das hunderte Stunden lang. Es war so toll, dass man nicht davon ablassen konnte.\n\nEntsprechend war die Vorfreude auf den 2. Teil gro\u00df.\n\nNun habe ich den 2. Teil an Missionen durchgespielt, nach gerade mal 18 Stunden. \u00c4h, wie bitte?\nEigentlich sollte man meinen, der 2. Teil toppt mindestens den 1. Teil in allerlei hinsicht. Jetzt kommt aber die gro\u00dfe Ern\u00fcchterung. In fast allen Belangen ist m.E. der 2. Teil dem 1. um Meilen unterlegen.\nAber warum denn:\n\n-Viele Features aus dem 1. Teil sind entfernt:\n-> wie z.B. vorher/nachher Bilder. Hei\u00dft, einmal Mission erledigt, sieht man davon nichts mehr im Spiel, genau so beim Renovieren von H\u00e4user. Man sieht nichts mehr was man geleistet hat.\n-> Fenster Putzen macht keinen Sound mehr. Auch wenn man mit dem Gummischaber \u00fcber das Glas wetzt.\n-> Kamine kann man nicht mehr anschalten\n-> Monitore, PCs, Tastaturen kann man nicht mehr anschalten\n-> Sounds sind generell recht eindimensional z.B. beim Platzieren von Gegenst\u00e4nden\n\n- Streichen der W\u00e4nde, total umst\u00e4ndlich. Man muss jedes mal aufpassen, dass man andere Elemente nicht \u00fcbermalt, muss mit der Maus kilometerlang \u00fcber den Schreibtisch fahren. V\u00f6llig ungenau.\n\n- Werkzeugmen\u00fc: F\u00fcr mich viel umst\u00e4ndlicher als im 1. Teil. Man muss ins untermen\u00fc vom untermen\u00fc vom untermen\u00fc. Das nervt. Auch wenn man z.B. das Werkzeug wechseln m\u00f6chte z.B. vom Verkaufs-tricorder zum Pinsel oder umgekehrt. Das bedarf manchmal schon einem wilden \"zur\u00fcck\"-rechte Maustasten gespamme.\n\n- Einstellungen des Spiels:  M.E. fehlen elementare Dinge wie z.B. wo kann man die Mausradrichtung zum Drehen von Gegenst\u00e4nden \u00e4ndern? Dr\u00fccke ich die Maustaste nach oben, dreht der Gegenstand nach unten. Warum eine Inverse maus hier? V\u00f6llig wirr. Und das kann man nicht \u00e4ndern. Solche einfachen Dinge gibts in jedem Spiel. Hier nicht mehr.\n\nPositiv:\nEs gibt nat\u00fcrlich neue Features die gefallen wie z.B.\n- das Bauen und abrei\u00dfen von W\u00e4nden finde ich besser\n- H\u00e4userdesign bei den Missionen ist recht innovativ\n- H\u00e4user zum Kauf die auch nicht in Missionen vorkommen sind teilweise sehr sch\u00f6n\n\nFazit:\nTrotz einiger Verbesserungen und nat\u00fcrlich neuen H\u00e4usern und Missionen wirkt es dennoch deutlich, dass das Spiel einfach vor Weihnachten hatte online gehen m\u00fcssen, egal ob Dinge fehlen oder nicht ganz ausgereift sind. Nichts desto trotz war es Pflicht es zu kaufen. Ich bin auch davon \u00fcberzeugt, dass der ganze fehlende Kontent noch folgen wird. Jedoch finde ich es schade, dass es so ausgerollt wurde. Es ist ein gutes Spiel, jedoch mit deutlichen abstrichen zum 1. Teil. Daher leidet der ganze Flair des 1. Teils drunter und auch das \"Suchtpotential\". \nAuf dem 1. Teil habe ich z.B. 538 Stunden Spielspa\u00df auf dem Tablett, beim 2. Teil ist nach den 18 Stunden nun die Luft schon raus. \nDaher gibt es stand jetzt nur eine negative Bewertung. Potential auf \u00c4nderung, wenn alles nachgeholt wird, was bislang fehlt und die Dinge besser werden.\n\nP.s.

Beim 1er hat man Anhaltspunkte gehabt z.b Der eine wollte 2 Badezimmer, der andere zwei Schlafzimmer mit Trainingsraum usw. dadurch konnte man Gewinn machen weil man die W\u00fcnsche der Kunden umsetzen konnte, dies ist hier nicht der Fall. Man kann die Geb\u00e4ude mit wenig Gewinn oder gar kein Gewinn verkaufen. \n\nDas Streichen der W\u00e4nde verh\u00e4lt sich wie beim Fensterputzen man f\u00fchrt die Maus hin und her und streicht so die Wand. Die Idee ist realistischer wie beim 1er aber das Handling ist wirklich nicht gut umgesetzt somit ist das Streichen beim 1er besser. \n\nMan kann mit Q fehlende Putzstellen finden dies konnte man beim 1er skillen und hat die Flecken auf der Minikarte gesehen. Hier liegt es am Spieler selber welche Variante er lieber mag. Ich fand auch hier die Minikarte besser als nach blinkenden Stellen ausschau zu halten. \n\nIch wollte das Spiel zur\u00fcckgeben, da es sich mehrfach bei mir aufgehangen hat, teilweise die Grafik verpixelt war und das Spiel meiner Meinung nach komplett im Schatten von HF1 steht aber auch dies blieb leider erfolglos.

And why can't your mirrors reflect anything? It's 2023, game engines today does a good job with this not impacting performance much. At the very least make it optional in graphics settings.\n\nThen there's also the question of modding, yes the game supports modding - but their current definition of \"modding\" is allowing you to create a custom plot/house via an editor and share it on a 3rd party website instead of Steam Workshop as before, where it also included people to share custom items to use in-game as well.\n\nThey also removed the feature to where you sell your house and it showed before/after pictures and comments from potential buyers to increase the sale price. Now you're just slapped with an offer from 3 different people without any information or pictures.\n\nI could also argue this would've been better served as an update to HF1 instead of making a new title.\n\nI'm 100% positive the limited stuff is to feed their future DLC's, I have no doubt in my mind they were in the game - but were deliberately taken out pre-launch just to be added back later as DLC. There's absolutely no reason for these things to be missing when the first game had them. -respect Frozen District. I thought better of you.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some positive things.

sangat bagus, perubahan yang jauh signifikan dari terdahulunya. grafik yang lebih memanjakan mata, voice acting yang menarik untuk didengar, UI yang lebih menarik, UX nya juga jauh lebih baik dari yang pertama. control mapping nya juga lebih enak. banyaknya interaksi yang bisa kita lakukan pada object juga menjadi sentuhan yang sangat bagus. good job untuk developer. \n\nyang lebih statisfy adalah animasi dari tools nya. tapi disini juga point minesnya. melihat animasi alat cleaning yang akan berubah sesuai dengan bahan apa yang sedang kita bersihkan sangat menyenangkan sekali, belum lagi angle tools yang berubah saat kita membersihkan tempat vertikal atau horizontal. cuman sayang, kesempurnaan ini belum tergolong lengkap karna animasi vacum yang masih menyerap pada pendahulunya (copy paste animasi cleaning menggunakan sapu di House Flipper 1) padahal animasi tools yang lain begitu menyenangkan untuk dilihat, tapi saat mau menggunakan tools vakum, kesenangan itu seketika hilang. sayang sekali mengingat penggarapan animasi tools yang lain yang improve jauh lebih baik, tapi developer jadi terkesan malas untuk mengerjakan animasi saat menggunakan tool vakum. maksud saya, ini adalah game house flipper dengan fokus utama membersihkan, menyikat, mengecat dan lain lainnya, sayang sekali jika fokus utama itu sendiri digarap dengan kurang sempurna. \n\nsaya akan mengganti

Everything else is the same for both versions and all versions going forward I assume.\n\nSo, I can\u2019t refund this game, nor would I want to. Great time killer. I will however be waiting to play much more until an update is addressed. This should not have a green check mark. I have the steam deck OLED model after selling my old one, and it is so poorly optimized, it makes the new cooling fan feature seem like it isn\u2019t there. It taxes the battery super hard as well. What\u2019s worse, halfway through every other job on default settings, it bricks the deck temporarily. It makes the deck emit a very loud fan sound and completely become unresponsive, requiring a hard power restart, which in turn actually destroyed a small micro SD card I was using and I had to restore it. This games optimization is absolutely terrible for the deck, and playway should be ashamed on that end.\n\nThe game itself is physically (for a player) exhausting at times. You have to hold down the trigger (or mouse) and continue to scroll around with that. Wow. Not bad for short bursts, but playing more than an hour? Gonna hurt your wrists on deck, same on PC I bet. Lots of visual bugs as well, chairs clipping in and out of walls, certain items not loading every now and then (just restart the game).\n\nI think it could have used another few weeks of development, feel like it was rushed to be out for the holiday season. It should get a yellow check mark for playable if it crashes and makes your steam deck shutdown forcibly and corrupts micro SD card.\n\nLots of the gameplay mechanics that are improved are fun, enjoyable locations and story jobs, I\u2019m just sad that it\u2019s such unoptimized trash. \n\nWill continue to play it, but likely wait for an update.

You delete something you assume you can replace only to find out that it isn't ACTUALLY replaceable. It's not in the build menus or item list. For example, the triangular blocks used on staircases to fill gaps and make a straighter line or the fancy part of the pillar downstairs in the main house.\n\n2. You see an item or wallpaper used in a house that you'd like to use elsewhere, but SURPRISE! It's not in the item list, either!\n\n3. You want to delete a staircase and move it to a new locations? You can't! Apparently SOME things cannot be moved and renovated, but only sometimes. There is no uniformity and clear answer as to WHY this sometimes happens, but it's frustrating when you want to adjust stairs only to be stuck with a design you don't like.\n\n4. The item/build lists are really messy. You type something to search by and half the time it doesn't give you anything remotely close to what you need. Like \"box\" doesn't bring up every type of box as it should, for example. So then I have to search with other words or use the tabs until I find something I'm looking for.\n\n5. My personal favorite (100% sarcastic) is that sometimes the game will completely destroy HOURS of progress. Spent four hours renovating the downstairs of the first house only to come back from an Assembly minigame and find all of that progress reset. But the game kept the in-game money I used for the renovation.\n\n6. Lack of ways to communicate bugs/errors/issues. I couldn't post a question here on Steam because it's locked for certain people only; and when I tried to post to Reddit forums to check if others were having issues, the post was taken down almost immediately by moderators. My last (albeit petty) resort is to post a downvote review and hope the developers check the negative responses so they can maybe fix a few of them - especially the spontaneous reset of four hours worth of renovating because that was so incredibly frustrating.", "timestamp_created": 1702851259, "timestamp_updated": 1702851259, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537037014961242676", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153821558": {"recommendationid": "153821558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047242803", "num_games_owned": 973, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 608, "playtime_at_review": 578, "last_played": 1702852124}, "language": "english", "review": "Thumbs down because the game is missing a ton of content from the first game including basic stuff.

Be it more customizability, positioning etc. though the appliances/fixtures and other things feel very limited while other details just missing. It might be nitpicky but these are more or less basics in a home/property that we had in HF1. I do hope we get these things in future updates and mods, but not behind a paywall with DLC's. (leave those reserved for other things, we don't need another EA ethic towards the bare minimum that should have been there from the start.)\n\n- The story felt short and most the lots weren't as silly as HF1, no reason to get mad at peoples horrible design choices.\n- No bathroom towels (the towel we have is just far to small, unless you dry off with a dish towel)\n- No curtains or blinds\n- Very limited furniture model options - as much as I like modern furniture, where is the old \"Grandma's house\" style or more Industrial wood and metalwork ? Why are we stuck in the IKEA showroom ?\n- Still can't stack bowls.\n- Various options of fruits and other foods yet not even a bowl of fruit - Can't fit more than 1 apple in the largest bowl\n- Most of the ceiling lights options are very small and those large enough look very out of place depending on the style you are \ngoing with. (Wish we could at least adjust the size of them.) Also lacking in options/styles.\n- No buyer preferences - the personality is gone.\n-No before and after view\n\nI could really start nitpicking but this is the general/main points.\n\nAll in all, there is a major focus on the new features and caters only certain aesthetics. Most furniture is kind of lackluster and lacks what makes everyone unique. Basics are missing the charm and goofiness of buyers is gone, there is no \"goal\" outside of story homes. In all honesty, as much as I am finding the game in of itself enjoyable, it needed more time to feel like a full base-game. It does hold potential for the future if more options and things are added, but otherwise it might be better to hold off until then to purchase the game. \n\nTL;DR : Game lacks many basic things and is very limited when it comes to creativity with the given interior furniture.

I'd give it a 5/10 at best right now. I'd say wait for a sale or wait until more content is added and it's patched accordingly. Overall I'd say it needed double the assets, even though within them is a lot of scope for variance, its general designs that are lacking, at least for me. \n\nIt's frustrating that for every added bit of creative freedom or functionality the devs have added, there's a major step back one way or another. Unless I'm mistaken then major gripes for me are:\n\n- Not being able to import your own pictures is a huge mistake. The degree of personalisation you could get is now gone and you're left with barely 20 or so stock assets for pictures/posters etc. Also no chance to take your own photos in game. WHY TAKE THIS STEP BACK? (unless I've missed it). Why not have a portfolio you can take pictures for, a chance to tour done houses would be even better. WHY NOT HAVE THIS? I CANNOT EMPHASISE HOW BAD THIS IS ENOUGH (sorry for the caps). \n\n- Why does this relatively simple game eat 80-90% of my CPU? Needs better optimisation. \n- Lighting is fixed from HF1 (no overspill as far as I can tell), yet worse due to general lack of designs. Seriously, all the stock lamps are pretty horrible. The ability to wire lights is great though. \n- Improved textures but no mirror reflections, candles don't light etc. No light from cookers, hoods etc. Why step back on such details? I don't get it devs! \n- Flooring and ceiling tiles/panels are now a chore - no click and drag to coat an entire floor or ceiling, instead you get blocks you have to click repeatedly. Painting is better though.\n- No before or after photos. I would have thought an album/portfolio you could look at would be great. Even better if you could visit your completed homes but no. They're done and forgotten like it never happened, but you can buy them again and they reset - great.  \n- Removing windows leaves a gap you have to wall up and then add a new window into. Why change it from the functionality of the first which just rebuilt the wall? \n- Why remove the need to assemble things if you're going to add an animation for every single wall you build? I like that I can just add toilets/showers etc and move them freely, but why add extra animations elsewhere? An option for wall animations on/off would be nice.  \n- No timer in the HUD so I can't see how long I've spent on a property. \n- Panels/tiles have no counter so you can't tell when they'll run out and you can't top them up like in the first game, so you have to wait until you're out completely and then grab more. Why?\n- Poor store menu. It's much better with a dedicated menu for each room type. Yet they've added Home Appliances which is great - again, 1 step forward, a major step back. \n- Uses it's own in game currency for things - why? I really liked the options for \u00a3's/$'s etc. Instead the cost of everything feels random. \n- No requirements or room titles is an odd choice. I like the freedom but I also feel that the amount and size and nature of rooms could and should add or detract from the total cost of a flipped house in some way, even if it's minor.   \n- No basic pools, no sauna, little to no towels etc. Why can't I buy a hanging towel? No, I have to by a rack and then hang the towel on it. It's little things like that that irk me.   \n- Why can't I at least cut the grass in the basic game? I don't think that's too much of an ask.  \n\nI really hope the Devs don't get greedy with DLC and that they patch the game with new assets and UI improvements every now and then. I felt the DLC for the 1st game was decent enough. I'm sure with mods and more assets etc the game will get better but the inability to import your own pictures, the weird give and take changes, the lack of core assets in particular with lights and the utter lack of a record of your work are big errors for me. I found it more frustrating than enjoyable, it's like playing a downgraded version of the 1st game. So why bother?\n\nI am disappoint and it makes me sad :(\n\nPlease Devs, let us tour our goddamn work and let us import pictures to hang up. Pretty please. I'll buy you cookies.     \n", "timestamp_created": 1702837035, "timestamp_updated": 1702837035, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54170304536819458", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153807384": {"recommendationid": "153807384", "author": {"steamid": "76561199049718850", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 301, "playtime_at_review": 267, "last_played": 1702838076}, "language": "english", "review": "i kinda regret buying this as it's overpriced for what you get. the first game is fine. this one has some new AWESOME features but also has made some big mistakes. where are the curtains? why is it so confusing to find things? why can't i assemble things?", "timestamp_created": 1702836921, "timestamp_updated": 1702836921, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52371138334274292", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153807117": {"recommendationid": "153807117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198405861024", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1702741286}, "language": "english", "review": "Feels like a cheap knockoff game just with a High price tag.

It's by no means a bad game but I'm mostly disappointed after looking forward to this for months (and avoiding spoilers).\n\nThere are many improvements over the first game, such as the dramatically increased freedom to change objects. Some quality of life features are things I really missed in the first game, like the duplicate feature or the ability to change object styles. Visually, it's absolutely lovely and I enjoy the story bits very much.\n\nAs for the negatives: \nA lot of UI things where I'm unsure if I haven't found the option or if it's missing/requires specific actions to unlock, such as...\n- seeing all open quests for a house\n- selling a house (after buying your first house to flip), this is probably explained but if so I don't know what I need to do to trigger this explanation. I shouldn't have to look up videos or guides for a cozy casual game, though.\n- getting out of a sub menu for color changes for things like beds (probably exists, but couldn't find it). Seems to be a bit inconsistent, didn't really have a problem for surface coverings. The paint menu for example is great.\n\nAs for tools:\nIn general: \n- You have to move furniture around to change the walls and floor. QoL downgrade imo\n- No more assembly required, apparently. Feels like playing the Sims. I suppose this could be seen as an improvement, but I found this part of HF1 very satisfying, which is the main point of playing a game like this for a long time for me.\n\nPainting: Feels very clunky. Being able to limit the painted area is great, but I cannot figure out a way to not have to select an area and just get started. Also, the large brush is nice but can only be used on a 3x3+ square area so it's a bit of a minor improvement. Also, since your camera is locked to the selection area, moving it around is tedious and slow.\nTiles/Panels: \nSo much clicking. At least it's fast from the start.\nCleaning: Already tired of walking to a bin all the time. A lot less satisfying than it used to be in the first game. If taking out trash has to be a realistic chore, I want to mount a sink properly. :(\n\nPerks: Feels like there should be more improvements to unlock for many tools, though the flipping tool upgrades are really good.\n\nI have to admit that I hoped for prettier HF1 with new content, more freedom and a better UI, this is not that.\n\nPS: I hope you can edit reviews later because judging from the improvements made to HF1 over time, I expect this to be a whole different story in a year.", "timestamp_created": 1702812341, "timestamp_updated": 1702812341, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153781425": {"recommendationid": "153781425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280453746", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 63, "playtime_at_review": 63, "last_played": 1702807883}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u73a9\u4e8630\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u6655\u4e86\u4e00\u665a\u4e0a\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f3D\u6655\u7684\u540e\u52b2\u597d\u5927\u3002\u614e\u5165\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1702810894, "timestamp_updated": 1702810894, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599766910076141357", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153781380": {"recommendationid": "153781380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065273710", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1191, "playtime_at_review": 1183, "last_played": 1702893963}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e1c\u897f\u662f\u597d\u73a9\u7684\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u5185\u5bb9\u592a\u5c11\u4e86\u4e0d\u503c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ef7\u683c\u3002\u623f\u5b50\u6ca1\u51e0\u4e2a\uff0c\u5bb6\u5177\u6ca1\u591a\u5c11\u3002\u6bd41\u4ee3\u5dee\u8fdc\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1702810836, "timestamp_updated": 1702810836, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508928596973419189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153780722": {"recommendationid": "153780722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880276710", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 858, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 858, "playtime_at_review": 427, "last_played": 1702851378}, "language": "danish", "review": "The game looks good and runs okay.

Maybe someday down the line, if/when they fix a few things, I can come back and update this. \n\nFirst off, I do like all the customization options, as well as the sandbox mode. I also enjoy most of the new tools, or at least don't mind them. \n\nBut painting. Painting is painful. If it wasn't such a key aspect of the game, I might ignore it, but the new painting mechanic is hard on the wrists. My mouse was all over the place, and if I had a traditional mousepad, it probably would have been way off it. It does allow for more customization with the free paint mode, but I don't think that makes up for the controls.\n\nCarpet. There's no wall to wall carpet as flooring. Again another little thing that's just weird to leave out. If there was only one type, I'd understand, but we have a million types of wood and tile... but nothing soft for the feetsies.  :(\n\nNo minimap and no replacement. The minimap in the first game was great for if you missed a piece of debris or a stain. Sometimes those things can be hard to see or even impossible. I've cleaned stains I couldn't see just by flailing around with the brush. It would be nice if there was a way to highlight the things like dirt and stuff that needs to be vacuumed.\n\nNo before and after montage! While this doesn't affect gameplay, taking it out really seems to defeat the purpose for me... part of the fun is seeing the transformation. I don't know if they ran out of time or couldn't get it to work right, but I hope they add it back in the future.\n\nI went into this game excited, and understanding that it wasn't going to have all of the bells and whistles of the first game, as well as new mechanics in general.

It's one of my favourite games of all time. I have been so excited for HF2, looking forward to the ways they were going to expand on the first game. Instead, what we have been given is a game with beautiful graphics but none of the soul or humor of the first game.

I know the keys can be changed, and it was my fault for doing it so late, but I wouldn\u00b4t imagine there\u00b4s not a way to return the call or some pop up window saying \"are you sure?\" or something.\n\nDon\u00b4t get me wrong, I love the game, the graphics look amazing but... in a way it doesn\u00b4t feel like HF, at least not yet, I don\u00b4t know... I\u00b4ll keep playing and edit if needed once I move further into the game. For now, it\u00b4s a \"no\" for me, I wish I would have waited a bit more.\n\nEdit: So I\u00b4ve played about 7 hours, and let me tell you... it\u00b4s boring :/ pretty much the only thing you do is cleaning, and I know HF is about upgrading your tools to do things faster but, \ncome on! I\u00b4ve played 7 hours and it doesn\u00b4t seem that the game is going to give me anything else than that stupid cloth and the spray... like!! I hate it, it takes WAY TOO MUCH to clean every little stain, is insane!\nWhere\u00b4s my \"house flipping\" job??? Am I a house-maid??? am I only a cleaning service?? I don\u00b4t remember HF being this slow at early stages, I went for my... 6th?? house I was like \"ah... no...\" when I see all the stains, so I closed it. I\u00b4m not cleaning anymore with that TINY FKNG CLOTH!\nAlso, why there\u00b4s no more list of ALL the pending tasks, why do I have to go room by room to know what I need to do there? I miss the whole list of things on a side, the \"3 starts\" thing is so senseless, I felt more accomplished with the percentages and the completion rate. \nThe people that hire me to do jobs are souless, they sent you and email with emojis asking for things, you clean the house and that\u00b4s it. If you\u00b4re lucky they call and say \"oh yeah, don\u00b4t do this or do that\", I don\u00b4t know, one would think by how HF looked at the latest stages they will continue from the good point of the game, but no...\n\nI love the fabrics, and the fact that you can change colors, textures and patterns, THAT is amazing, but please make the \"copy style\" more intuitive, I copied one couch style to a chair and it left a purple cushion (that I couldn\u00b4t change btw) on a black and red pattern, and I couldn\u00b4t change it, I had to sell it and edit it from scratch because I didn\u00b4t have the option, nor the points yet to edit a furniture... One shouldn\u00b4t need to wait all the way to have enough perk points to have edit and copy styles... THAT\u00b4S BASIC.\n\nAnyway, I\u00b4m leaving it here. Probably I will leave the game and return once it\u00b4s pulished, like this, it\u00b4s sorta unplayable.\n\nEdit: I played another 2 hours and I finally found the buy and sell houses, finally I am house flipping...

I have issues as does everyone else and will list them below. It is important to note I have not played much in terms of the base game playthrough, so I'm basing most of my experiences off of the sandbox mode.\n\nPro's:\n- Smooth as butter to run, there has been only a couple of janky occasions and they were rectified quickly with a restart.\n- The colour choices is phenomenal, being able to really choose the detail I'd like just scratches that little brain itch.\n- Property sizing and spacing options. It feels so nice to be able to design on a larger scale more freely without worry of too many rooms or houses on one plot causing the game to crash (hf1 reference)\n\nCon's:\n- My biggest gripe thus far has to be the absence of curtains. I feel as though this absence tends to break my whole visualisation of a room. Being unable to soften the edges of a window or cover up the harsh outside light just grates on me.\n- Lack of choice in roofing. I will not deny the ability to make and customise the appearance of roofs were and are far beyond my expectations. My issues lie in the lack of customisability, I miss hf1 where I had all these varying tile choices and colours, in that aspect it feels quite rushed and an after thought. \n-No carpets? I understand the use of rugs and such, but a soft carpeted floor really ties certain styles of decor. It's absence hasn't gone unnoticed particularly for myself where I'm having to use wallpaper as the flooring finish, noticing the lack of depth or quiltiness (sorry couldn't think of a better word) of a carpeted floor.\n- Issues/ absence when using surface quests, the whole idea behind sandbox was to make jobs or houses to enjoy. But I cannot choose a surface for a quest on stair brickwork or other things such as moldings and certain curved brick windows. Meaning I have to add them in as standard which ruins the immersion of the potential project.\n-Lack of furniture choices. I know if hf1 there was limited choices to begin with and more rolled out in dlcs but I find myself limited by what's available in terms of stylistic choices. You can't capture the vision in your head it's mostly compromise or go without. This is particularly evident in the lack of wall art and mirror variation. I loved hf1 for its great array of wall art. Being able to hand pick abstract wall art to match my theme or a more traditional style painting to go with an older style.\n\nTo summarise this long-winded (I'm sorry) review, I like the game. In fact I find it's a peace of mind at times. But I can't recommend it to people when I feel as though for certain individuals these issues I mentioned would break their Immersion or ruin their experiences. As I've said and will reiterate the game feels half-done, seems as though the developers rushed into throwing it out without including some of the best features of it's predecessor. And hence my review. If these issues are rectified or some are I'll make sure to edit this review accordingly.

When you put your time, blood, sweat, tears, life and passion into a game sequel, focusing on smoother and more interesting gameplay, higher quality visutals, and overall enhanced experience, it means nothing to the player when the game deletes your saved work. \n\nI should have waited before buying it the day it came out. I was too excited for this, so much so I put down my dark urge play through of baldur's gate 3 to play this.  I paid ~$35 after a 10% discount, so it isn't a cheap game. As of now I think that is WAY too overpriced. Here are the main issues that are too important to overlook, and until they're fixed I don't see myself playing again and wished I hadn't wasted my money:\n\n1. After putting in hours of fixing my home, after many auto-saves, the game deleted HOURS progress. When I went to do the tutorial on how to put together furniture, my house reverted back to before all of those hours of work had been done.  A glitch this obvious and bad should not be in a fully completed game. This was when I turned off the game and decided I need to work on my life choices.\n\n2. There is no before and after photo feature!!!! This is the very reason people like house flipping shows to begin with, and the reason it's even more satisfying the worse the starting point is. To see the shocking overhaul! And this game just left it out. They missed a big reason people even play, it's hard to understand how the devs could be so out of touch.  Maybe I'm missing a hidden way to activate it, but when you go through all the work to complete the jobs and feel good about the finished product, you just appear back in your home without any wrap-up. No voice message from the person thanking me for finding their stupid microwave. No photo show of the before and afters. And I don't see where to take photos at all. This is a big disappointment. \n\n3. Too few furniture and design options. There are no paintings. NO PAINTINGS!! There are plenty anime posters for some reason but no nice wall art. \n\nI hate the way games are now, when they're released you don't know if it's going to be finished. I feel this is the case with house flipper 2 unfortunately.

The choice of furniture, colors, floors etc is way smaller than 1st one, but I'm hoping this will change with any DLCs in the future. Another thing is that categories are kinda chaotic, I often struggle to find paint, floors etc. Adding windows and doors is also a pain for now, not as easy as it was.\nI think for now it's a good game, but 1st one still is more player-friendly. I replay it often, I don't know if I'll replay this one.\n\nEDIT: After playing some more I need to change my review. No, this game is not a good part 2. There's little to no content. You finish the main quest fast and you are left with not much to do. Building is still frustrating, I don't like the new painting mechanic and placing floors is more tedious.

Even if you wanted to decorate your own house is not enough. \nAlso, there is no invert button so if you painted something by accident - welp, too bad. \nI feel like part 1 had more lore, fun interactions and the whole flipping was more satisfying with actual before/after photos.

I've turned my mouse sensitivity all the way up to try and counter this with barely any difference other than too fast of a mouse just moving around the house.

Its also timed, which makes it stressful.\n- The selection in interior items is so tiny, there are VERY few styles to chose from!

Also there are no clues about when/if I'll learn the two remaining greyed out tools (sledge hammer and some other thing).\n\n\nPros\n- Some things are more customisable and smoother than in House Flipper 1, like tiling, lighting and painting.\n- No clunky installation processes when placing bathroom appliances, like in House Flipper 1. \n- You can place garden plants, yey!

I think the system in HF1 was more engaging where you just grab your brush and dive in, and upgrades felt more rewarding.\n- Tiling is much easier, you just target and click. It takes about 1/4 of the time to tile a wall compared to painting the same area. Doesn't make sense.\n- There's no assembly for appliances. You just buy and place, like Sims. There are, however, assembly mini games where you get % off on specific items if complete or finish fast enough. I didn't bother to complete all since money is not a problem in the game.\n- There are no pipes, or drainage in the buildings. You don't have to align appliances to specific places.\n- I've played 8 hours and never seen night time. I think they removed day/night cycle.\n- You can route wall/ceiling lamps to switches, but it has no gameplay value (there's no night time).\n- Upgrades feel unnecessary. For example, there's a spray upgrade to cleaning tool which helps you clean the current zone much faster when you spray. Cleaning tool is already so fast, so it maybe saves you half a second. Every tool works so fast in this game, if not instantaneous.\n- There's a three star system when you complete a job just like the mobile games. I left a couple of trash bags in one of the houses and still got three stars.\n- They replaced the mini map with eagle vision that doesn't see through walls. If you're not looking directly at the area you're missing, you have to go to each room and spam eagle vision. \n\nOverall, it feels like the game wants you to get rid of the cleaning, scrubbing, painting and tiling as fast as possible (assembly? what's that?), and makes you open the store and spend an hour on decoration. It feels much like Sims than a House Flipper game.\n\nPros:\n- So many options in the store, and they look much better than the first game\n- Graphics are better\n- New snapping/grid line feature is fantastic\n- Houses you go feels more like the person who sent you the email is living in. Attention to detail in houses are very well done\n\nIf you like the decoration aspect of House Flipper, I think there's big chance that you will love the game. But unfortunately that was always the most boring part of House Flipper for me.", "timestamp_created": 1702703767, "timestamp_updated": 1702704312, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518013656139373779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153688927": {"recommendationid": "153688927", "author": {"steamid": "76561199114501484", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "playtime_at_review": 24, "last_played": 1702706051}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc544 \uc815\ub9d0 \uc18d\uc0c1\ud55c\ub370\uc694...\n\uc811\uc18d\uc740 \uad1c\ucc2e\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc628\ud1b5 \uac80\uc740\uc0c9 \ud654\uba74\uc774 \ub418\uc5b4 \ud654\uba74\uc774 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4\u3160\u3160\n\ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc788\uc744\uae4c\uc694...?\u3160\u3160\u3160", "timestamp_created": 1702701990, "timestamp_updated": 1702701990, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153688744": {"recommendationid": "153688744", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040773594", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1757, "playtime_at_review": 1688, "last_played": 1702875049}, "language": "english", "review": "There are no curtains in this game.

Vorher hatte ich Positiv f\u00fcr das Spiel gestimmt. Leider muss ich mich jetzt dagegen entscheiden.\n\nNach jetzt etwas mehr Spielzeit ist f\u00fcr mich klar, HF1 hat mir bisher besser gefallen. Ich erkl\u00e4re euch warum.\n\nPRO : \n \n\u2022 Der neue Baumodus wo man selbst sein eigenes Haus gestalten kann ist eine wunderbare Neuerung. Da kann wirklich jeder so bauen wie es ihm am besten gef\u00e4llt. Find ich echt super.\n\n\u2022 Die \u00dcberarbeitete Grafik gef\u00e4llt mir auch sehr gut. Diese passt gut zum Stil des Spiels.\n\n\u2022 Das M\u00fcll aufsammeln mit dem M\u00fcllsack finde ich, ist eine lustige Abwechslung\n\n\u2022  Das W\u00e4nde bauen ist deutlich besser gel\u00f6st als beim Vorg\u00e4nger \n\n\u2022 Die Neuerungen am Mulitoolwerkzeug finde ich auch klasse \n\n\u2022 Das Fliesen und B\u00f6den legen ist besser gel\u00f6st. Wesentlich angenehmer als beim Vorg\u00e4nger\n\n\u2022 Das Streichen geht um einiges Schneller  ....\n\nCONTRA :\n\n\u2022 Beim Streichen bleibt man nur auf einer Stelle stehen und man muss die ganze zeit die rechte Maustaste gedr\u00fcckt halten, sonst bricht der Vorgang ab. Finde ich nervig\n\n\u2022 Das Fenster putzen war in HF1 etwas sch\u00f6ner. Da tut sich nicht viel aber mit 2 kr\u00e4ftigen Mausbewegungen gl\u00e4nz das Fenster. Man gibt sich keine M\u00fche, weil keine notwendig ist. \n\n\u2022 Es gibt bisher ziemlich wenig M\u00f6bel etc. zu Kaufen ( Ja ich wei\u00df es kommen Updates f\u00fcr die Inhalte ), stand jetzt, ist man sehr beschr\u00e4nkt \n\n\u2022  Was zum Fi*** soll dieser Montagemodus. Meiner Meinung nach ist dieser Modus v\u00f6llig unn\u00f6tig. In dem Montagemodus kann man Schr\u00e4nke, Tische etc. sehr sehr detailliert  zusammenschrauben. Das ist wirklich gut umgesetzt worden. Aber wof\u00fcr... um ein Paar % Rabat beim Kaufen der jeweiligen Produkte zu bekommen ?! Je mehr Sterne man bei der Montage erh\u00e4lt , umso h\u00f6her sind die % und da es bei der Montage um zeit geht, kann man das nichtmal richtig  genie\u00dfen, weil man nat\u00fcrlich versucht so schnell zu sein wie es geht. \n\nWieso hat man die Montage ( meines Erachtens eines der besten Features in HF1 ) komplett aus dem Spiel entfernt. Nichtmal Steckdosen muss man mehr anschrauben. Man kauft einfach Sachen und klatscht sie dahin wo es einem gef\u00e4llt. F\u00fcr mich der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Kritikpunkt\n\n\nFazit:  Das Spiel ist gut, keine Frage. Aber f\u00fcr  Diejenigen, die HF1 gespielt haben, werden erst einmal entt\u00e4uscht werden. Daf\u00fcr das es ein neuer Teil ist, hat es meiner Meinung nach einen deutlichen R\u00fcckschritt gemacht. Klar alles sieht neu und schicker aus, ein paar Mechaniken Funktionieren anders. Die Funktion bleibt aber die gleiche ( Putzen, Staubsaugen z.B.  ) Also wieso sollte ein potenzieller K\u00e4ufer knapp 40 Euro f\u00fcr ein Spiel ausgeben, dass weniger Features, aber die selben Aufgaben hat wie der Vorg\u00e4nger \nIch bin mal gespannt mit wie vielen DLC\u00b4s wir diesmal rechnen k\u00f6nnen. \n\nIch k\u00f6nnte jetzt noch ein paar Zeilen mehr schreiben, aber dann liest sich das bestimmt kaum einer durch :)", "timestamp_created": 1702678399, "timestamp_updated": 1702852498, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153670726": {"recommendationid": "153670726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150320624", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 62, "playtime_at_review": 62, "last_played": 1702676983}, "language": "english", "review": "Within one hour I already went through a great handful of houses and messed with the building aspect.\n\ni got to say I feel like they really missed the mark on this.

I'm not sure what they are going for here because even smaller European homes aren't this cramp. So many rooms are nonsensical and its not like in the first game where its bad design that you have to fix, its just how the game expects houses to be and you have to work with it. Customizing your own renovation isn't very fun since there is only so many things you can do sensibly for the placements of the rooms to make sense. Its not inspiring to be creative.\n\nInstead of adding in more depth to their systems, they simply dumb down everything which makes things less satisfying. Need to put a window into a wall? Just buy one and place it where ever, no need to knock down the wall and shape it the way you need to. Flooring, wallplacement is boring, assembly is nonexistent,  no real yard work besides placing some plants. There isn't much variety in the furniture aspect.

I own HF1 with all of the DLCs and enjoy HF1 very much. My review may be picky to some but I write this review with having both HF1 and 2 in mind.\n\nCONS:\n\nThe music.\nCompared to HF1, the music just doesn't do it for me. It seems very bland. Sounds like the same boring track on repeat. I ended up turning it off and playing HF1 music track in the background instead. In HF1, you could also add your own music in files and play them on the in-game radio. In HF2, the radios don't even work.\n\nNight/Day.\nYou cannot change the time of day - at all. You cannot sleep in a bed to make it whatever time you want. You also cannot turn off night cycle in settings.. more things missing that are in HF1..\n\nThe perks.\nMost of the perks are okay I'd say. But they feel lacking. They don't really feel like upgrades. Especially when it comes to spray, painting, etc. More on this below. \n\nPainting.\nI am trying so hard to like painting in HF2. I really am trying, but I just can't come to like it. While using your keyboard is a lot easier, it still takes SO MUCH time. You also end up having to re-paint the same areas, which wastes paint, which wastes time/money. It just feels very bad. I can't imagine the frustration console players have with this. \n\nCleaning.\nEven with upgraded perks, I am not a fan of this new spray/rag cleaning. I'd rather have the mop from HF1. The upgraded spray barely makes a difference and even with full upgrades, there is still a delay with spraying the spray. Having to constantly fill up garbage bags and throw them in the dumpster is annoying.\n\nThe shop.\nWhy is everything all over the place? The categories are all over the place and feel chaotic. I go into a room to place furniture and give up half way through to go work on another project. Why are all the categories scattered? You'd think clicking on the \"Bathroom Products\" category, all of the bathroom decor, etc would be in there right? Wrong. No towels, bathroom soaps, mirrors, etc. \n\nLack of items. \nI realize this is the base game and it just released but there are not many items in the game. There are more food items than there are table lamps, etc.. Barely any doors to choose from. \n\nSurface finishes.\nThis is what promoted me to finally write a review. I CAN'T stand putting down flooring. It is such a pain in my behind. Even with the FULLY upgraded surface finishing, the area is SO small. Putting down flooring/walling behind items is SO annoying. More than half the time I need to move the items , put down flooring/walling then place the item back. I wish I could place things on an entire wall or even a line. It just feels so, so bad. I am trying to do the exterior of my house and I spend so much time on a small house.\n\nMoving items and placing them together.\nI am currently renovating the \"Lavender House.\" The windows above the doors made me realize how bad this feature is. I moved the window above the door so I could paint. After I painted and wanted to move the window back in it's place, it just wouldn't let me. I finally gave up and made some different windows work. Now I'm moving the columns outside where the driveway is.. THE SAME EXACT ONES THAT WERE THERE WHEN I BOUGHT THE HOUSE.. and now I can't move them back after painting/flooring.\n\nSame bugs from HF1 making into HF2.. seriously?\nI was picking up garbage from one room, and it kept saying I still had garbage to pick up. The entire room is EMPTY. Nothing at all. There is a basement so I went down there, cleaned up garbage, go back up top.. now says no garbage. If you paint or tile over spots that needed to be cleaned with a rag, you are SOL. It will still tell you that you have a spot to clean. A lot of me falling through walls, not being able to place items, my character getting stuck on items, etc.\n\nNo buyers?\nI loved the personality and buyers from HF1. Why would you get rid of that? While I'm working on a house to sell, I love having goals/buyers in mind. I don't have anyone to yell at me there's still garbage, or no beds, needs more plants, etc.\n\nI am just so frustrated with these things that I had also encountered in the demo and hoped they would be fixed. Is the game beautiful and fun to play? Sure it is. But it is also so frustrated at the same time. It leaves so much to be desired that HF1 gave. I spent my time typing out all of these CONs that I don't really have much to say that is PRO. It is a really beautiful game, I got the discount for having HF1 and the DLCs - that was really cool. This game has a ton of potential that's for sure. And while I may play this for the time being, I would rather go back to HF1. I expected a lot more from Frozen District. It makes me sad that I'm this disappointed in HF2 when I was so hyped for it.\n\nTL;DR House Flipper 2 is missing a lot of things from HF1 that really made it House Flipper to begin with.", "timestamp_created": 1702670370, "timestamp_updated": 1702670370, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.656998634338378906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153662397": {"recommendationid": "153662397", "author": {"steamid": "76561199161502033", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 46, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1702667307}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a hot mess.

It's very cartoon like as others have stated and even after adjusting blur and other motion settings gave me motion sickness within 5 minutes. There are not many furniture options like HF1. I miss the old tools immensely. Who wants to walk around filling up trash bags then having to take them all the way outside to the bin? I miss the old way where you just click a button and trash is gone. Cleaning is not good either, you have to be right on top of what your cleaning or you won't get it. I miss the larger cleaning radius of the mop. Tried house building too kept falling through the ground. It took forever to figure out floors. This game should have never been released in its current state, it has a long way to go. Sadly it will probably never get there. This is a big let down. I can tell that they had big plans to give us more options but there just isn't any follow through. They took a lot of ideas from builder simulator which is also pretty rough. Waited a year for this and I'm very disappointed. The price point is also very high considering the quality it is. I got the discount for owning all of HF1 and DLC but it was still $30. The state of the game it's only worth $15 maybe $20 tops. Sure there are some new features but you still get much less than the original. There should be options to use old tools if you want.

Not wood.\nVisually its minecraft and sims had a baby. (please devs will you sell me the HF1 texture pack)\nAs another poster said they themselves didn't bother changing the design/colour of bought things in jobs, I did that too and I left things wherever they landed after purchasing them. No design, no point when they don't show you the finished home like they did in HF1. And it looks so ugly. Childish. Unreal. Fake.\n\nOh why are the fabrics on the bedding upside down? Why no window dressings? I do like that I can put things on a table then move the table. I have not tried everything but after reading  reviews I know there are things I will dislike.\n\nSomeone on here complained about holding the mouse button down and getting fire pain, they should try a controller! Pain Pain Painful right trigger, the springiest key does so much, holding a key fighting me (even pushed it against table for a while) to paint a wall I cant paint til I mark the area I want to paint... Right trigger is used most and constant pressing for everything. \n\nSo I remapped via Steam remapping. No in-game controller remapping so wrong keys show for what to do now. On HF1 there were four ctrllr options to choose from. Why oh why did the devs not port these so we feel familiar with HF2, but no, so on HF2 its all alien feeling and pain fire pain from constant fighting springy RT.   So I needed, via Steam remapping, to swap R and L triggers to bumpers and vice versa. It has recognised my triggers to bumpers in game, but it wont recognise bumpers to triggers in game, I have lost any LB and RB options... So I have to use keyboard for seeing bits missed which is 'Q' (oh devs please bring back the map, so helpful for 1 tiny piece of dirt or tiny square of floor missed under a door), and complete the job which is LBRB, now cant do that on ctrllr, only keyboard (which is a pain for me) or any other LB/RB specifics all have to be done on keyboard now.\n\nI have been waiting so long wanting to build with the new HF2 engine, something amazing. 1 amazing home, just one. But after playing it, I know I will be using no wood at all (which I love), so it for me will be ugly but not as ugly as using HF2 wood.\n\nThe 3 stars system and no buyers wanting specifics, no progress bar. Why? \"If it aint broke, dont fix it\"\n\nHF2 physically hurts and it visually saddens compared to HF1.\n\nI would like to thank you Devs for taking the tedious bathroom installs out, but you have made the walls and floors surfaces so very tedious and ridiculous.\nI am currently on 409.5hrs on HF1 on Steam, which I bought after doing much more than that on xbox, HF1 is the reason I joined Steam because it had more DLC than xbox had.\nAm 9.9h on HF2 and I have already had enough. at least 4 hrs of it was waiting for fire pain to subside enough to continue.\nI sat down to play HF2 nearly an hour ago and I dont want to, would rather write my first review instead. Maybe I'll throw some paint on my real wall n watch it dry, no fire pain and much less depressing than the expectations and playability I had of HF2. (yes I played the trial)\n\nsorry Devs.\n\n\n*Edit,         I have just been reading more neg reviews and a dev responded to one of them with\n \"We're taking notes, glad to see your feedback, and we'll for sure listen out for what our community says in order to plan out any future updates.\nNo worries, we'll still be supporting HF1 through various bug-fixes, updates, and even a new DLC!\"        \n  hmmm. Wish I'd stopped before the hour now and got a refund. But I wanted to give it a fair go even wasting time with learning new and painful controls/mechanics. Wish I hadnt stopped playing HF1 for a month to be fresh for HF2.  I love HF1.  I couldn't care less for HF2, all that time waiting for its release, what a waste of excitement.\nAlso bit worried that the house I nearly finished yesterday then went back to 'my house' before exiting the game, has been reset if what other reviewers say are true, that u must manually save before leaving any property, cos HF2 doesn't auto save, and the money spent is also lost.     What?!\n\nAll these testers musta lied their faces off, did not one come to the Devs with pain concerns at least -mappable controls solve that? Or said HF1 lovers will hate the visuals, mechanics (painting!, floors!) and style and many things of this? No autosave when popping home? Etc etc?

I love it.\n\u25cf The furniture being able to be colored almost however you'd like was MUCH needed. huge improvements there!\n\n[h2]Negative (there's quite a bit):[/h2]\n\u25cf Why did we replace the mini-map with this builder sense..? It's abysmal.\n\u25cf No master quest list. You're expected to waltz through every room mashing your menu to find what you've missed\n\u25cf No curtains, wall to wall carpets, slanted walls, arched doorways, and a TON of other things left out from HF1. why go backwards? It feels like a prequel comparatively.\n\u25cf Gardening has been removed completely. now its just \"put an object down\". Feels very sims-like. not a fan\n\u25cf As mentioned above with just placing objects, no more installing components like heat, plumbing, or electrical. Half of the fun was feeling like you're truly building/renovating a home.\n\u25cf No workshop? I know the IO is meant to house a lot of that stuff but it seems to be more-so for maps and jobs rather than objects. the community really adds to these games, let them.\n\u25cf Can't import pictures anymore, that's a true shame considering all the empty frames.\n\u25cf The before and after wasn't something I realized I would miss. After finishing a job I'm finding myself feeling unsatisfied.\n\u25cf The percentage of the job completed is necessary. I've had a \"3 star completion\" a few times. but it turns out that may be a HUD bug because it will then give me 2.99 stars because I missed the last pixel of one clean job in a room (shout out to builder's sense) and it rounds it down to 2 stars despite the 3 stars being fully lit. Just add what percentage of the job is finished. It makes sense..\n\u25cf No mention of HOW to raise price when flipping a house. Potential buyers no longer tell you what they even want? We're left to guess what is good or bad. That's unbelievable. How are you going to slouch on house flipping when that's the NAME of the GAME? for real?\n\n\n[h2]Final Thoughts[/h2]\nAll in all it feels like a general downgrade from HF1. Some things were improved but at the cost of so many good features being canned. It's hard to tell if the devs left these things out because of a change in vision or as a way to squeeze more money out of the community by selling things that should have been in this game though DLC in the future. One would assume the devs would have put all they learned over the lifespan of HF1 into this game to start and sold dlc of things they hadn't thought of, like they did with the first one. You've already learned what the community wants, why leave it out? It makes the overall experience feel like most of the early access games I play. But atleast those are 5-20 dollars. Not 40. \n\nFor the time being i'm going to say it's not worth it and spend my time elsewhere, which is SO unfortunate. I've been keeping up with the discord and updates since it was announced. I was as excited for this as I possibly could have been. I guess I'll wait another year or so and hope the devs update it to add these things, sadly it's in vogue to charge 200 dollars for a complete game by adding necessary features as paid dlc months down the line so i'm expecting that.

I don't like the grids for painting, tiling, papering and flooring. I don't like the fact I can't see the percentage that is needed finished of the whole mission. Is it 3 stars to full completion or 3 stars, that'll do and can end task now? The fact I can't line up the pool balls on the table drove me wild! My ocd was off the charts at not being able to line them up next to each other or put them in to the triangle or putting the toilet rolls in to the bottom drawer and couldn't line them up nicely either.

Loved it! However, HF2 is lacking in areas that DEFINITELY should have been addressed before it's initial release.\n\n1. WORST PROBLEM OF ALL!: There are no \"INSTALLATIONS\"! What the heck were you thinking? There is no plumbing work? No toilet, bath, sink, shower, or radiator installations? There is no damaged electrical outlet fixing or air conditioner installing? How about plastering walls? Where the heck is that? What about furniture restoration? Did you forget about that, too? These were some of the coolest things about HF1!!! All this game is, is cleaning, and buying and selling furniture! Terrible, man, just terrible!\n2. Fireplaces and candles do not work! This is ridiculous, primarily the fireplace thing! When I saw that the fireplaces don't work, it was very disheartening, very disappointing!\n3. No before and after shots of the work you've done! This is absolutely and fundamentally inane!\n4. No curtains or blinds? What? This doesn't even make a lick of sense! This is contemptible!\n5. I have carpal tunnel and gout in my thumbs, and painting, as many, MANY others have alluded to, sucks; especially for people with any wrist issues or arthritic conditions. This is ridiculous!\n6. The store is a convoluted disaster. It is simply nuts trying to navigate through it to find what you want or need. It is even difficult to casually browse! This is just ignorant!\n7. The following is SO freakin' annoying: When I build a piece of furniture (say, for instance, a counter for the kitchen), and then go to make the next piece of kitchen counter, all the settings I chose for the first piece (top, handles, front, etc.) should still be selected! Technically, the counter tops you are building should match, right? I can't remember a bunch of different settings that I selected initially over and over and over again, unless I write it down. I shouldn't have to do that! They should be pre-selected from what I chose for the first one I built. They should ONLY change if I change them!\n8. I hate Ikea-type furniture with a passion, and everything looks like it was purchased right out of an Ikea store! Could it be the overly cartoonish graphics? Maybe. I have all the settings related to \"video\" on Ultra settings, but it doesn't really take the cartoony-ness out of it. Maybe you can add some less \"modern\"-looking furniture.\n9. ANNOYING BUG: After I am done with floors or walls, I cannot immediately get back to the radial menu. I have to pretend I am going to the Store to exit that function and then re-select it.\n\n1ST NOTE TO DEVS: Please Devs, do not put your copy & paste reply for issue #5 on this review. Instead, tell us when the fireplaces are going to work, when the curtains & blinds are coming, when you're going to add the ability to INSTALL plumbing and electrical, and when before and after shots will be added like they should have been from the get-go! You should have made things like the train set in the MCs house work, as well. Actually, many things that were interactive in HF1 are not in HF2! Why? Isn't this supposed to be an upgrade from the original product?\n\n2ND NOTE TO DEVS: I will add to this as I progress, but some things, while being great for DLC and updates, should NOT have been overlooked (those mentioned above - primarily #s 1-7 + the bug).", "timestamp_created": 1702662343, "timestamp_updated": 1702735881, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153655679": {"recommendationid": "153655679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198187536643", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 486, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1702679065}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is fun in some ways,  but this one makes me really sick.

Everything is way more cartoony than HF1... certainly an odd decision. \n- HF2 is not accessible in a lot of areas. Unintuitive mouse clicks and gestures such as painting- which SUCKS by the way.

The parcels in HF2 are always the same, just the houses around are changing but no substantial changes that would make the plot interesting and getting you passionate in building something\n-gameplay feels clumsy and tedious, if they implement a mode that is less tedious like in HF1, my personal gameplay experience would be improved.

I absolutely loved building new houses and modernizing existing ones in HF1. This style of gameplay was however more enjoyable in HF1. HF2 lets you build awesome houses with less restriction that couldnt be built in HF1. This is however hindered by somewhat uninteresting surroundings that feel very generic and dont exactly make you want to build something, very limited selection of windows, surfaces, doors and very time consuming and borderline infuriating gameplay.\nI\u00b4m certain that this game can be miles better in every aspect in the future.

I'm sorry if there are any spelling mistakes in advance.\n\nThere are many nice features in the game, for example, you have the feeling of spiderman to find the dirt :) but sometimes you cannot find it, there is only one dirt, it takes a long time to find it :S. It has the ability to copy and paste or change the color, which is nice and you can buy land and design your house the way you want, which is great, but I haven't experienced this yet, I'm going through the story a little more, cleaning makes me tired :S It's hard at first, but after spending some hours, you get used to the search features and designing quickly.\n\nI organized my first house, painted it, changed windows and doors, and arranged the furniture. Then I went to another job and came back and the house I changed was back to its previous state, there were some bugs, so my hours were wasted. There are not many modern structures and items, there are old fashioned items, many items in the DLC are not innovative.\n\nThere is a lot of garbage and a lot of dirt just to make the gameplay longer, so is this game a cleaning simulator or a house design game?\n\nGRAPHICS QUALITY IS DISGRESSIVE, it's pretty disgraceful compared to the first game, but you just put up with it. While the graphics in the old game were more realistic, the new game is a DISGRACE in this regard. So why do you offer childish graphics in your new game when it should offer more realistic graphics? I'm really obsessed with the graphics, I wish it was like the first game...\n\nThe producers do not do this in this game, but I hope the modders will make adjustments to this game to create better graphics. And I hope there will be more modern item options.\n\nAgain, in the first game, buyers would request that there be such and such items in this room, and we would shape the house according to those requests, but this feature does not exist.\n\nWhen we were organizing and selling the house, we would first see the old version and then the new version, but they removed it.\n\nNo buyer feedback. (Like in HF1, when you put the house up for sale, you would get comments like \"+the house is clean\", \"-the walls are damaged\" etc. from the buyers and it would give you an idea of what price you could get). that's not it!\n\nIn short, I will say DO NOT BUY this game for now due to fewer items, worse graphics, removal of the features I mentioned above and many bugs compared to the first game. The dollar is rising, the discount is ending, it's up to you. I bought it, I made a mistake, returns were not accepted, I will have to spend time in the game. There are no DLC Packages in this game as in the first game. Now I think they bring the features one by one with DLC like in the first game, for example, the before and after of the house, farming, animals, buyer requests, everything that was delicious in the first game is gone.", "timestamp_created": 1702625088, "timestamp_updated": 1702916255, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495049476623535156", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153624494": {"recommendationid": "153624494", "author": {"steamid": "76561199016177279", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 606, "playtime_at_review": 251, "last_played": 1702808175}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "I don't recommend this game because the gameplay lacks a lot of things that were in part 1, the first part had a much larger selection of almost everything. for example, gardening is also quite limited, hopefully in the near future the developers will make available (for FREE (in the second part you should have gotten everything from the previous part)) with an update, all the functions that were in the previous part. my opinion will hopefully change soon. happy holidays.:)", "timestamp_created": 1702624777, "timestamp_updated": 1702624777, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153624083": {"recommendationid": "153624083", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094101186", "num_games_owned": 1265, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 245, "playtime_at_review": 88, "last_played": 1702929462}, "language": "english", "review": "On Steam Deck your options are the game looks bad (really bad), or sub-20fps when cleaning windows.

Summary: Great update to the first, updated mechanics for some tools and lovely graphics, but lack of _any_ buyer feedback (or buyer personalities like in HF1) makes it not fun for me to actually flip houses.\n\nI cannot recommend this game for most people until this is added. You might enjoy it if you like more abstract sandbox style play? If you have played HF1 you will probably be frustrated by this. If you have not, then go and play HF1 instead of buying this.\n\nWas very excited for this, bought it day 1! I played HF1 a lot, with all the DLCs, and enjoyed it tremendously, although it was not a perfect game. So even if this was basically HF1 with an updated graphical engine and new houses/jobs I would have been extremely happy. However, I am very much not. Unfortunately you have to play through a few job levels to start buying houses, and I was not in a rush and did a few so by the time I realised the lack of the buyer feedback mechanic I already had too many hours logged to request a refund. This review will remain as a not recommend for me unless this changes :`( \n\nPROS: \n- It's beautiful! Graphically very pretty, lots of cute details\n- Updated mechanics for many tasks, cleaning, painting, surface finishing (formerly tiling), that I prefer overall. \n- Cute easter eggs, story, details in the houses\n- Vastly expanded aesthetic choices\n- Changed the assembly mechanic entirely (a very tedious part of HF1 in my opinion), big improvement.\n- Really adorable art style for loading screens and other supplementary things.\n- Probably a lot more, and I look forward to (hopefully) being able to edit my review to recommend so I can find more things I like about it!\n- Nice relaxing music (although could use more variety)\n\nCON: (There is only one I found but as mentioned before, for me it is fun-breaking).\n\nThere is no buyer feedback (like in HF1 when you put the house up for sale, you would get comments from buyers like \"+house is clean\", \"-damaged walls\" etc. to give you an idea of how you can get a better house price in general.\n\nBeyond the general buyer feedback, if the buyers in HF2 have individual preferences there is no indication of that. In HF1 the buyers had personalities and related individual preferences. There were different family configurations from single people to large families, who wanted different amounts of bedrooms. They liked modern or rustic furniture etc. etc. etc. \n\nIt was not perfect in HF1, the range of personalities got a little limited and repetitive after a while, but it provided more structure and interest than just cleaning everything and repainting damaged things. This just doesn't seem to exist in HF2. It really undermines what otherwise seems like a well made update to a game I sunk too many hours into.", "timestamp_created": 1702618073, "timestamp_updated": 1702618073, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605732202529907227", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153620740": {"recommendationid": "153620740", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992095676", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 36, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1702604753}, "language": "english", "review": "Sadly, I currently cannot recommend this game.

Has a more \"casual game\" flavor, despite being somehow more confusing. As if they were suddenly trying to target a different, perhaps younger audience. It's kinda lame, but manageable.\n\nThird - Some things I'd assume would be mandatory staples are straight up missing. Carpeting? Curtains?\n\nFourth - It's lacking some attention to detail. A good example is the action icons for mouse interactions. Every mouse icon a right click indicator, even when the action is done with the left mouse button.

I also don't like that you can accidentally trash things you are supposed to sell - which you cannot know without constantly opening the tasks. Get rid of the trash bag concept - I hate taking out the trash IRL too. And, please, please PLEASE bring back room labels and the task list being on the main playing screen regardless of the tool you have open. Job percentages - bring those back too!

There are some great quality of life upgrades \u2013 the ability to duplicate items, clone designs, etc.  I also really like that there\u2019s a storyline of sorts, it gives the game more personality.  \n\nSo I was absolutely devastated to realize that accessibility seems to have been completely forgotten.  Every single mechanic in the game requires sustained mouse button holding, with no alternate configuration options available.  This was an issue for me in HF1 as well, but not nearly as bad \u2013 the long press on the mouse button was largely in short bursts, aimed at one spot.  \n\nIn HF2, when painting, applying certain wall or floor coverings, etc, you\u2019re guiding the mouse \u2013 while holding the button down \u2013 to color in large areas in small blocks at a time, rather than a whole section (or floor-to-ceiling strip) like the last game.  This combination of hold + move is a MASSIVE problem to anyone with carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis, or other nerve conditions.  I spent about 10 mins playing around with the painting tool, stupidly hoping that adjusting mouse sensitivity might help, and now my right arm is on fire.  \n\nNaturally, it took me just over the allowed \u2018refund\u2019 time to discover how bad the controls are, and TBH I would hate to refund anyway, the devs generally seem like decent sorts and (aside from certain mechanics), it\u2019s really enjoyable.  However, in its current state, House Flipper 2 is literally painful for me to play.   It would be great to see similar option to Power Wash Simulator, which has a \u2018toggle on/off\u2019 option for the sprayer \u2013 without it, that game would be unplayable as well for people with disabilities, injuries, etc.  Or even just an option to select a complexity or difficulty level for various mechanics.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1702585701, "timestamp_updated": 1702585701, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1390, "votes_funny": 44, "weighted_vote_score": "0.895450890064239502", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1702651454, "developer_response": "We believe this is currently one of our biggest overlooks!\n\nGood that you're letting us know how serious this problem is for you.\nI can completely see your point, as a couple of years ago I experienced some carpal tunnel syndrom sympoms myself, and I can at least partially understand the struggle.\n\nWe will definitelly try to come up with a solution to that in the near future.\nDesigning and implementing this functionality cannot happen overnight though, but we promise to prioritize this issue.\n\nCheers! <3"}, "153595863": {"recommendationid": "153595863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198385003861", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 330, "playtime_at_review": 13, "last_played": 1702919503}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me parece muy descarado que aprueben esto para Steam Deck con un tic verde; Todos los ajustes gr\u00e1ficos est\u00e1n al m\u00ednimo posible se ve muy mal y a\u00fan as\u00ed da bajones de FPS.

I loved house flipper 1, everything about it, and was really excited for House flipper 2, but playing it makes me so frustrated. Maybe I just don't have brains, but I have no clue how to operate the game. I find everything in this game so confusing, like I can't find anything?? The shop is really messy. Where can I buy houses that are ready to flip? I don't mean sandbox mode or the houses that have tasks and u must do what the customer asks, I mean just houses, where are they? Also, in the sandbox mode, I couldn't even figure out how to build floors. This game is not intuitive at all. I feel like I should read a guide to do anything. Also I very much dislike the clumsy, cartoony look, I liked the realistic, sharp look that house flipper 1 had. Somehow this game gives me motion sickness?? I tried different settings but that didn't help. And I hate how much time cleaning takes now, why did u add more steps? This is not a cleaning simulator. Like first u have to collect thrash into a bag, then the bag gets full, AND u have to walk outside to throw the bag away and then u have to repeat that multiple times because all of the thrash wont fit into one bag. I highly doubt that anyone actually plays this game cuz they love the cleaning part, it's just something u have to do to get to the fun part, which is flipping houses and being creative, trying different looks etc. Idk, maybe I was hoping for house flipper 2 to be just more creative compared to 1 and have more options on what is possible, and in some ways it actually IS more creative, but at the same time this feels like a completely different game.

Now that I had an opportunity to play the game, I can give it a fair review.\n\n[h2]The Bad[/h2]\n\n[h3]Optimisation[/h3]\nThe first glaring issue that I noticed about the game, is the optimisation, or lack thereof. Even on low settings, there are frame rate stuttering issues, even though my PC meets the recommended specs. The game is still playable for me at least, but a fix to this issue would be greatly appreciated.\n\n[h3]Controls[/h3]\nCompared to the first game, some of the controls feel more clunky? For example, when cleaning windows, the controls feel less efficient and require a lot more wrist movement which can cause issues for people with arthritis, carpal tunnel or injuries in general. \n\n[h3]Graphics[/h3]\nSome people like it, some people don't. The graphics look far better than what they do on the first game, but at the same time it looks more...cartooney? I do prefer more realistic graphics on a game like this but I've yet to experience the full graphics of this game once the optimisation issue is fixed.\n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThis is more personal preference, but I don't really see the point for having a story in a house renovating game? This addition gives me the impression that the developers took House Flipper and The Tenants and fused them together somehow? Some people may like this addition, but others may not.\n\n[h2]The Good[/h2]\n\n[h3]Snap to grid function[/h3]\nThis feature is such a blessing for placing items, which makes life so much easier. Placing items in the first game was a chore but this feature has made it waaaay more bearable.\n\n[h3]Duplicate item function[/h3]\nBeing able to duplicate an item or its style has made renovating the house a lot easier rather than having to go back into the menu repeatedly.\n\n[h3]Sandbox mode[/h3]\nBeing able to experiment with different styles, building techniques and different furniture is a great way to experiment in-game and figure out which style suits you best. \n\n[h2]The Verdict[/h2]\n\nAs the title states, this sequel may be hit or miss for some people? Others may absolutely love the new style, while others may dislike this new approach to House Flipper. Right now, in its current state, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game until the optimisation issues are fixed. When a game is launched but doesn't run as expected, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth personally. The developers however are engaging with such feedback and are taking notes from it, which is more than can be said about other game studios. I'll update my verdict on this game once the issues have been fixed, but for now, I'd wait until the game is improved before buying.
